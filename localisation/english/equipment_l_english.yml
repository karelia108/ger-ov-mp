The turret was the same as in the T-26 m 1933 and BT-5 tanks, and also equipped with the 45mm 20K main gun. The biggest limitation of the BA-6 was the mobility, limited to roads or very hard ground, the result of unnecessarily large weight. The innovation that slightly improved mobility were the auxiliary tracks that could be fitted onto the rear tandem wheels, converting the car to half-track. The important improvements of the BA-6 were the new GK tires, filled with much less vulnerable sponge rubber. On the downside, the tires reduced both the speed and range. All cars of this series were very heavily armed for the era; they could knock out other vehicles with ease, including tanks. However, their thin armor of 9mm at the front and 15mm at the turret made them vulnerable to heavy machine gun fire and small caliber cannon fire."

The basic BA-10 design was developed from the BA-3/6 heavy armored cars and carried the same turret and 45mm 20K gun at a weight of around 5,2 tons. It had an improved GAZ-AAA chassis and improved armor (up to 15mm at front / turret). The BA-10 used a slightly smaller, better-sloped armor layout than that of the BA-6, thus improving protection while saving weight. The greater engine power (50 hp, compared to 40 hp on the BA-6) made the vehicle more reliable and allowed a top road speed of 53km/h. Like its predecessors, the BA-10 could be converted to a half-track by fitting auxiliary tracks to the rear pair of dual tandem wheels. The tracks were often fitted when the vehicle needed to move across snow or soft ground."

The BA-64 represented an important watershed in Soviet 장갑차 technology, as its multi-faceted hull ( with frontal armour of 15mm) gave its crew superior protection from small arms fire and shell fragments compared to the BA-20. BA-64s also possessed a much higher power-to-weight ratio and the placement of their wheels at the extreme corners of the chassis resulted in exceptional manoeuvrability. The BA-64 was initially armed with a single 7.62mm Degtyaryov machine gun in an open-topped turret.The machine gun was mounted on a fixed mount that allowed it to be elevated sufficiently to engage low-flying aircraft."

Official designation was Leichter Panzerspähwagen Sdkfz.221 (Light Reconnaissance 장갑차 -Special Purpose Vehicle 221). 340 were delivered from 1936 to 1939. This four-wheeled vehicle proved to be fast ( 80 km/h ) and agile, but it quickly became apparent it had limited off-road capabilities. In some cases, the original MG was swapped for an anti-tank rifle 39 or, later, a model 41 28 mm anti-tank gun, in order to increase its firepower. The armor was suitable against small arms fire and shrapnel. It was crewed by 2 men."

The original 6 Rad (6 wheel) versions were based on a 6x4 truck with an armoured body, but its offroad mobility was insufficient and by 1937 they were being replaced by the 8 Rad versions. The Sdkfz.231 had 15 mm of slightly sloped front armour. Production versions of the SdKfz.231 were fitted with a 155 HP, eight-cylinder Büssing-NAG L8V-G petrol engine, which gave a top speed of 85 km/h. From July 1942 they were built on the same Einheitsfahrgestell chassis and had their armour increased to 30 mm. Later a more powerful engine was installed, providing 180 PS instead of 155 PS. It had all-wheel-drive, all-wheel-steering and two driver positions at front and rear. The turret in the 231/232 series was a hexagonal shape and equipped with a 2 cm KwK 30 L/55 autocannon and a coaxial 7.92 mm MG 34 machine gun."

When the driver turned the steering wheel all eight road wheels not only turned but also tilted in order to bend the tracks and make the tank turn; the idea was to reduce the mechanical strain and waste of power caused by the traditional system used to turn tanks by braking one track.

The 코메트, which was a development of the 크롬웰, rendered the Challenger obsolete, and ultimately led to the development of the 센추리온 tank. When firing APDS rounds, the 77mm HV was slightly superior in armour penetration capability to the 75mm KwK 42 gun of the equivalent Axis tank, the Panther. The hull armour was 74mm and the partially sloped turret armour was 57 to 102mm. With a weight of 33,5 tons and a Meteor III engine developing 600 HP its top road speed was 51 km/h."

Initially planned to weigh no more than  41 tons, the final L7 105mm L/52 armed version Mk.III weighed 52 tons instead.  A high top speed was not considered important, while agility was to be equal to that of the 코메트 using the same Meteor engine.

A BL 8인치 (203mm L/15) Mk.VI siege 곡사포 was placed on the flat surface on a pivot mount which allowed a few degrees of lateral movement. For crew protection foldable armoured screens were added which were lowered like skirts on the move. The gun could shoot a 91 kg shell over 9,8 km. Although the massive gun weighed more than the removed turret, the shortened chassis kept the weight the same and its mobility ( or lack of ) was similar."

Due to the massive recoil a muzzle break had to be added. A regular 토르데스 chassis was used and adapted. It retained most of its armour but needed a bulkier front, so the formerly conically angled central gun cradle had to become a cylinder. Its weight increased to 82 tons and the top road speed decreased to 17 km/h. The gun, which was a modernized WWI origin siege 곡사포, could fire a 130kg shell over a range of 17 km."

 infantry_tank_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Tank, Infantry, Mk I, 마틸다 I (A11) development began in 1935. The General Staff specification required a cheap tank, requiring the use of commercially available components. It resulted in a small two-man vehicle (with very cramped conditions) with a low hull and a small cast turret. The turret was fitted with a single heavy machine gun, either a .303 빅커스 machine gun or a larger, 빅커스 .50 machine gun. Designed for quick delivery as well as low cost, the A11 used many stock parts from other vehicles: a Ford V8 engine, a Fordson gearbox, a steering mechanism similar to a 빅커스 6-Ton Tank Model E variant. The hull and turret were well protected with up to 60mm armour, but the tracks and running gear were exposed and more vulnerable than on tanks that had protected tracks. The top speed of 13 km/h of the 11 ton vehicle was thought to be sufficient for supporting an infantry advance."

With its heavy and partly sloped armour of up to 78mm, the 마틸다 II was an excellent infantry support tank, invulnerable to early 대전차포s but with limited speed and armament. It was the only British tank to serve from the start of the war to its end, although it is particularly associated with the North Africa Campaign. It was replaced by the lighter and less costly 발렌타인. The 마틸다 II weighed around 27 t, more than twice as much as its predecessor, and was armed with a 오드넌스 QF 2파운더 (40 mm) tank gun in a three-man turret. One of the most serious weaknesses of the 마틸다 II was the lack of a high-explosive round for its main gun, so the tank had to close to 500m machine gun range to effectively combat 대전차포s or the 88mm 대공포. A high-explosive shell was designed for the 2파운더 but for reasons never explained, it was not issued."

The 발렌타인 infantry tank essentially used the same lower hull and suspension as the 순항전차 Mk.I, though with considerably more armour of a maximum of 65mm. It was armed with the same 2 pdr gun as the Mathilda and had – apart from lesser armour – same performances and around 12 tons. It however was much cheaper to build and with Mk.VIII it was finally upgraded to a 6 pdr gun and even to a QF 75mm with the Mk. XI. Despite the gun upgrades the chassis was never uparmoured. The initial engines with 131 HP were upgraded up to 210 HP but top road speed stayed around 24 km/h."

The design expected that war in Europe might be fought under similar conditions to WWI, and emphasized the ability to cross difficult ground. Vauxhall began working on the A22 in June 1940. Power was provided by a twin-베드포드 Vehicles engine of 350 HP, which was effectively two engines in horizontally opposed configuration ("flat twelve") on a common crankshaft. The top road speed was 24 km/h for the 40 ton vehicle.For the 처칠 types up to VI the armour was a maximum of 102mm on the frontal hull and 89mm on the turret front. The 처칠 I had a 2 pdr. gun in the turret and a Mk.I 3in 곡사포 in a fixed mount on the hull. The 처칠 II replaced that troublesome 곡사포 with a machine gun."

Problems with the plates used in an all-welded design led to an alternative cast turret also being produced and the 처칠s with the different turret became the Mk.IV. The CS version with a 95mm Howitzer became the Mk.V.  The Mk.V received the longer barrelled 6-pdr ( 57mm L/50 ) gun but basically they were all very similar and many got later converted to Mk.VII standard by bolting on armour or replacing the turret."

It is sometimes called the Heavy 처칠 and was re-designated as the "A42" in 1945. Earlier 처칠s were gradually converted to the VII standard in amour. The Mark VII turret that was designed for the 75 mm gun was of composite construction – cast with top and bottom plates welded into position. On the Mark VII, the hull front armour was made up of a lower angled piece of 140mm) and a vertical 152mm plate. The hull sides, were, for the most part, 95mm. The turret of the Mark VII was 150mm to the front and 95mm for the other sides. The weight increased to 40,6 tons and since the engine was never upgraded the top road speed fell to 21 km/h. "

Due to the wider turret required, Vauxhall had to redesign the hull though it used as much of the 처칠 Mark VII as possible. Due to the increased weight, the running gear and hull were strengthened drastically. The same 베드포드 engine in a tank that was 10 tons heavier lead made it even more underpowered and slow than the standard 처칠. This resulted in an abysmal top speed of  16.8 km/h and, even though it retained the 처칠’s climbing ability. Armor on the turret face and hull was 152mm. The main upgrade that this vehicle gained over the 처칠 was the mounting of the 오드넌스 QF 17-Pounder Mk. VI cannon in a new larger pentagonal turret. The Mk. VI was an improved version of the gun with a shortened breach, allowing more operating room inside the turret of the tank.  "

 CCP_submarine_1:0 "AG 급"
 CCP_submarine_1_desc:0 "Amerikansky Golland (American Holland) class submarines were built in Canada, then delivered to Russia during WWI, where they were finally assembled. They were the direct copy of the successful Holland type submarines. They were designed to be good sea boats well-armed for their time."
 CCP_submarine_2:0 "시리즈 5 슈카"
 CCP_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Series V submarines of the Schuka class were the second-most numerous submarines of the Soviet Navy. Their large number came from their deployment to the four fleets of the 소비에트 연방: Black 씨, Baltic, Northern and Pacific. They were medium-sized patrol submarines with good torpedo armament and seaworthiness."
 CCP_submarine_3:0 "시리즈 14 K 급"
 CCP_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Series XIV submarines were large cruising submarines with extended range. They were essentially an improved version of the Series IV Pravda class. These submarines featured heavy armament of both surface guns and torpedoes. They had a long range but only satisfactory seaworthiness."
 CCP_submarine_4:0 "한 급"
 CCP_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Project 611 submarines (NATO Codename: Zulu), were the Soviet Navy's first submarine class to be built after WWII. Their design was based on the German Type XXI submarines, and they were meant to replace the older Series XIV K class boats. They were large, ocean-going submarines with a heavy torpedo armament and long range. They were used as a basis for the follow-up Project 613 (NATO Codename: Whiskey) and Project 641 (NATO Codename: Foxtrot) class submarines."
 CCP_destroyer_1:0 "30식 급"
 CCP_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Orfey class destroyers were an improved version of the previous Novik class. They featured adequate surface and AA armament for their size, somewhat short range, but good speed and heavy torpedo armament. The succeeding Fidonisy and Izyaslav classes were further improved versions of this class with increased main armament and hull size."
 CCP_destroyer_2:0 "39식 급"
 CCP_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny class (Project 7) destroyers were authorized under the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The class itself was heavily influenced by the Italian destroyer Maestrale and considered a successful design. Their displacement were in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they were well-armed and they had adequate AA and torpedo armament. Due to the powerful engines they were fast but short-ranged vessels."
 CCP_destroyer_3:0 "42식 급"
 CCP_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Soobrazitelnyi (Project 7U) destroyers were an improved version of the previous Gnevny class. Their engines were redesigned and they had a stronger AA armament. They displaced between 1,900 and 2,400 tons, and their speed and range were similar to the Gnevny class."
 CCP_destroyer_4:0 "52식 급"
 CCP_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Skoryi class (Project 30bis) was a further improvement on the Ognevoy class. The increase in size and displacement (2,500-3,100 tons) resulted in a more stable ship with an increased operational range. All ships were built after the War to a modular design that resulted in rapid construction and deployment times. Their armament was the same as that of the previous Ognevoy class, but the main guns were housed in twin turrets instead of single turrets."
 CCP_light_cruiser_1:0 "28식C 급"
 CCP_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasniy Krym class cruiser, originally the Svetlana class cruiser, had her construction started before WWI but the war and the following revolution delayed the completion of the entire class. In the mid-late 1920's, she was finally commissioned into the Soviet Navy along with her half-sister Chervona Ukraina (ex Admiral Nakhimov). These vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy. They were heavily armed and well-armored cruisers for their time."
 CCP_light_cruiser_2:0 "35식C 급"
 CCP_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Komsomolets class light cruisers were series of hypothetical vessels. They were somewhat of a mix of older and new technologies. Using the incomplete hulls of the Svetlana and Admiral Nakhimov classes, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer caliber guns and adequate AA armament they were suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall look of the ships bears similarities to the Kirov class cruisers."
 CCP_light_cruiser_3:0 "44식C 급"
 CCP_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Chapayev class (Project 68) cruisers were based on the Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers and authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. As the first true light cruisers of the Soviet navy, they carried a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with an adequate torpedo armament. Overall, these were good ships with a thick armor belt, high speed, a good operational range, and a displacement of 10,500 to 14,000 tons. Due to the war and the invasion of the German forces, many ships of the class were cancelled and the rest were finished after the hostilities ended."
 CCP_light_cruiser_4:0 "50식C 급"
 CCP_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Sverdlov class cruisers (Project 68bis) were the last gun cruisers of the Soviet Navy and were improved versions of the preceding Chapayev class. Compared to the Chapayevs, they had the same main armament, machinery and armor protection, but had increased fuel capacity for greater range, improved underwater protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and slightly better seaworthiness. They were designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts. Due to the advent of the missile age, many ships were cancelled or not finished."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "30식HC 급"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Kavkaz cruiser, originally the Admiral Nakhimov class light cruiser, was the half-sister of the Chervona Ukraina. Krasnyi Kavkaz was completed with a modified design that included larger-caliber 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. Because she was a rebuilt light cruiser, her armor was thinner compared to the heavy cruisers of other navies."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "38식HC 급"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers were the Soviet Navy's first modern cruisers. The design was based on the Italian Raimondo Montecuccoli class light cruisers and was built as part of the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The ships displaced between 7,700 and 9,200 tons. They were armed with new 180mm guns in 3 triple turrets and a solid AA battery. Their strong engines provided good speed and an acceptable operational range, while the armor belt was thin compared to other heavy cruisers."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "43식HC 급"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Project 22 heavy cruisers were designed in the mid 1930's to counter similar vessels in neighboring countries. The design called for a larger-sized vessel displacing between 15,500 and 17,000 tons. They were equipped with four triple 240mm cannons to fight off enemy cruisers, a heavy AA armament for self-defense, and a larger scout plane force to find the enemy. Their main tasks would be to scout for enemy forces and convoy hunting. The cost of the ships and the allocation of resources to other needs resulted in the cancellation of the project."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "58식HC 급"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Project 66 heavy cruisers were the Soviet Navy's last attempt to design and build a purely gun cruiser. Design studies started in 1943 and the final version emerged after the war. The vessels would feature 220mm cannons in 3 triple turrets and a strong AA armament. Displacement would be at least 26,500 tons. The advent of the missile age and the death of Josef Stalin caused the project to be terminated."
 CCP_battle_cruiser_1:0 "40식BC 급"
 CCP_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Borodino-class battlecruisers were class of four vessels authorized in 1914, just before WWI. They were based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic 씨. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of WWI and the Russian Revolution doomed these ships from ever being finished."
 CCP_battle_cruiser_2:0 "51식BC 급"
 CCP_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kronshtadt class (Project 69) battlecruisers were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program and scheduled to be finished in the 1940's. The original design aimed for a large-sized heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on German Scharnhorst battlecruisers arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons. As hostilities broke out between Germany and the 소비에트 연방, the ships construction was halted and eventually cancelled. Alternative plans called for finishing the incomplete hulls as aircraft carriers under Project 69AV."
 CCP_battleship_1:0 "저우 급"
 CCP_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Marat class battleships (originally Gangut class) were WWI-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only three ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernized and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They had modern electronics and a strong AA complement."
 CCP_battleship_2:0 "첸 급"
 CCP_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 21 battleships were designed in the mid 1930's to be part of Stalin's Ocean-Going Navy. They would be very similar to the British Nelson-class battleships. The ships would displace around 41,000 tons, would be armed with nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets (all forward), and a secondary armament of twelve 152mm guns. Its good AA armament and thick armor provided a strong defense against air and surface targets. The project was eventually cancelled but part of its elements were used in the Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) battleships."
 CCP_battleship_3:0 "주 더 급"
 CCP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lenin-class battleship was a hypothetical design to match and counter the German Bismarck and U.S. South Dakota class battleships. Its nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets would provide adequate firepower, while its 130mm AA guns, thick armor, and large engines would ensure its survival in battle."
 CCP_battleship_4:0 "마오 급"
 CCP_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Stalingrad class (Project 82) capital ships were intended to provide the Soviet navy with its primary firepower in the post WWII era. They were fast, well-armed, and well-armored vessels. Construction started after the war, but the death of Josif Stalin led to the cancellation of these ships, though there were projects to finish at least one as a modified design equipped with Soviet V-2 missiles."
 CCP_sh_battleship_1:0 "50식 초중전함 프로젝트"
 CCP_sh_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) was the last class of battleships built by the Soviet shipyards and were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. Four ships were planned with a standard displacement of 59,000 tons, three triple turrets carrying 406mm cannons, and a heavy secondary and AA armament. They also had strong engines to accommodate their very thick belt armor. The outbreak of the war prevented these ships from being completed."
 CCP_sh_battleship_2:0 "59식 초중전함 프로젝트"
 CCP_sh_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 23bis-class battleships were a modified and improved version of the previous Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23). Compared to their predecessors, they carried four triple turrets of the same 406mm caliber cannons, thickened belt armor, a revised layout of secondary guns, and stronger AA armament."
 CCP_carrier_1:0 "유린 급"
 CCP_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ismail class aircraft carrier was the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Borodino-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship would have a thick armor belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group would provide her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out due to costs and the state of the Soviet shipbuilding industry after the October Revolution."
 CCP_carrier_2:0 "상하이 급"
 CCP_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Vozdukh-class aircraft carrier was a hypothetical design to provide the Soviet navy air projection over its fleets. They were similar in size to the British Ark Royal or 일본ese Hiryu classes but carried additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armor results in a slightly reduced air group compared to these classes."
 CCP_carrier_3:0 "베이핑 급"
 CCP_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Project 71B carriers were designed in the mid-to-late 1930's. They were planned to provide air cover for the new surface fleets Stalin ordered in his plan. Two ships were planned that would displace around 30,000 tons, have strong AA armament, good armor, and an adequate air group. The German invasion caused the cancellation of construction for these vessels."
 CCP_carrier_4:0 "랴오닝 급"
 CCP_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Project 72 aircraft carriers were the improved versions of the previous Project 71 ships. Design studies finished in the early 1940's resulting in a larger ship with thinner armor. The extra space was used to install stronger AA armament and provide for the ability to carry a larger air group."

The Gewehr 98 action, using stripper clip loading with the powerful 7.92×57mm 마우저 cartridge, successfully combined and improved various bolt action engineering concepts."

 GER_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "By 1940, it became apparent that some form of a semi-automatic rifle with a higher rate of fire than existing bolt-action rifle models was necessary to improve the infantry's combat efficiency. The selected Rifle was the G41 (Walter) and it used a mechanism known as the "Bang" system (after its Danish designer Søren H. Bang). In this system, propellant gases were captured by a cone-shaped gas trap at the muzzle, which in turn deflected them to operate a small piston which in turn pushed on a long piston rod that opened the breech and re-loaded the gun. It included fixed 10-round magazines that were loaded using two of the stripper clips from the 카라비너 98k, utilizing the same German-standard 7.92×57mm 마우저 rounds. It suffered from fouling problems, since gasses at the muzzle cool down and deposit solid carbon fouling. The muzzle assembly consisted of tight-fitting parts and was difficult to keep clean, disassemble, and maintain in the field."

 AUS_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "By 1940, it became apparent that some form of a semi-automatic rifle with a higher rate of fire than existing bolt-action rifle models was necessary to improve the infantry's combat efficiency. The selected Rifle was the G41 (Walter) and it used a mechanism known as the "Bang" system (after its Danish designer Søren H. Bang). In this system, propellant gases were captured by a cone-shaped gas trap at the muzzle, which in turn deflected them to operate a small piston which in turn pushed on a long piston rod that opened the breech and re-loaded the gun. It included fixed 10-round magazines that were loaded using two of the stripper clips from the Karabiner 98k, utilizing the same German-standard 7.92×57mm Mauser rounds. It suffered from fouling problems, since gasses at the muzzle cool down and deposit solid carbon fouling. The muzzle assembly consisted of tight-fitting parts and was difficult to keep clean, disassemble, and maintain in the field."

It used a low-recoil 6.5x50mm cartridge which lacked penetrating power. It was a very long rifle, at 1.28 meters, due to the 일본ese emphasis on bayonet fighting. The rifle gained an additional 0.4m when the bayonet was fixed. About 3,400,000 were produced from 1906 to 1942."

While it was intended to completely replace the 38식, this never materialized due to resource and production constraints. About 3,500,000 were built from 1939 to 1945."

Due to the late stage of the war, corners were cut frequently in production, but the weapon still had great field performance. About 8,000 were built from 1944 to 1945."

The German word 그릴레 means ‘Cricket’: a small insect that makes a very  loud noise. It weighed 11.5 tonnes, had maximum armour of 15mm  and its Praga AC, 6-cylinder petrol engine with 147 HP allowed a road top speed of 35 km/h. Due to the low ammo load on board, gunless 그릴레 ammo carriers went with the unit. If a 그릴레 malfunctioned the gun could then be transferred to the ammo carrier."

With the Ausf M chassis, the engine was located near the middle of the vehicle, and the armament was placed at the rear in a specially designed armoured section. The superstructure could fold down to allow 360-degree traverse at low elevation. Including the single prototype, 141 대공포panzer 38(t)s were built from November 1943 to February 1944, entering service in 1944."

After Czechoslovakia was taken over by Germany, it was adopted by the German Army. Production ended in 1942, when its main armament was deemed inadequate. In all, over 1,400 Pz. 38(t)s were manufactured. The chassis of the Pz. 38(t) continued to be produced for the 마르더 3형 (1942–1944) with some of its components used in the later Jagdpanzer 38 (1944–1945) tank destroyers and its derivative vehicles. It was considered an excellent tank, especially compared to the Panzer I and Panzer II that were the Panzerwaffe's main tanks during the outset of WWII. The Panzer 38(t) performed well in the Polish Campaign in 1939 and the Battle of France in 1940. It was better armed than the Panzer I and Panzer II tanks. It was on a par with most 경전차 designs of the era, although it was unable to effectively engage the frontal armour of medium, heavy and infantry tank designs."

The armour of the turretless chassis and range of the mortar ( 6km ) enabled the Mücke to work behind as well as close to the front. The base plate of the mortar was under the hull and could be quickly lowered and retracted for movement and firing, the lowered base plate would absorb the recoil of the heavy mortar and protect the suspension.The ability to observe its own mortar shells impacts on the battlefield greatly increased accuracy while light AT fire could be shrugged off. It could not carry much ammo, so it had to rely on weaponless Mücke ammo carriers ( which could be converted with mortars recovered from disabled vehicles if necessary). "

This system is almost drag free but would have been very vulnerable to damage. However with the production version He-100 D-1 the cooling was redesigned to a conventional system and additional air cooled radiators were installed. The new D-1 was therefore slower but still managed a speed of 644 km/h. Due to the drag-reduced airframe ranges of 900-1000 km were possible.

One particularly acute problem arose with the lack of an alloy with a melting point high enough to endure the high temperatures involved, the service life of an engine was therefore 20-50 hours. The aircraft made its first successful flight entirely on jet power on 18 July 1942, powered by a pair of Jumo 004 engines.

When the follow-up 나카지마 Ki-12 proposal with a liquid-cooled engine and retractable landing gear was deemed too complex by the 일본ese officials, the Ki-27 was designed by Koyama Yasushi to have an air-cooled radial engine and fixed landing gear. The aircraft had the 나카지마 trademark wing with a straight leading edge and tapered trailing edge. Although it had worse top speed and climb performance than its competitors, it had outstanding turning ability. 3,368 were built from 1937 to 1942."

These turrets existed in four different models and configurations, although still mounted in the same locations, with the same height and generally same features. All had a 240° arc of fire and armor ranging from 13 to 15 mm (0.51-0.59 in), although the very first 1931 models had only 10 mm of mediocre alloy, susceptible to machine-gun fire.

A notable feature was the commander's cupola. This would not appear on other Soviet tanks until 1942, which instead relied on panoramic periscopes. The 45mm 20K gun was housed - as break from previous Soviet light tanks - in a three-man turret as was the case on medium and heavy tanks such as the T-28, T-35 and KV-1. Additionally, all T-50s had radios, a feature only found on the commander's vehicle of earlier light tanks. It was very complicated to produce for such a small tank of 14 tons and despite being much more capable the cheap T-60 was preferred.

Whilst the 45mm gun was generally better suited to the reality of tank-on-tank warfare, it still had poor mobility. Armour thickness on the turret front was 60 mm, hull front and sides: 45 mm. The tank’s legacy passed on into the somewhat well-known SU-76 self-propelled gun, which was also a less than desirable tank. The T-70 was armed with a 45-mm L/46 gun Model 38 with forty-five rounds carried, and a coaxial 7.62-mm DT machine gun.

The KV-1 had a weight of 45 tons and powered by the 550 hp V12 engine a top road speed of 40km/h could be reached. At introduction of the T-34 the question has arosen if a heavy tank is necessary when a medium tank carries the same gun. Therefore it was upgraded several times with heavier armour and by replacing the F11 or F34 gun with a modified 76,2mm M1941 ZiS-5."

The 85 mm proved capable of penetrating the Tiger I from 1000 m and the demand for it slowed production of the KV-85 tremendously. The KV-85 appeared on the front beginning in September 1943 and its production ended by December 1943. Soviet industry was therefore able to produce a heavy tank as well armed as the Tiger I before the end of 1943. Although the KV-85 was an excellent opponent to the Tigers and Panthers, it was essentially a stopgap once the IS tank entered full-scale production."
 
 #"Heavy tank destroyer based on the KV-1. This rather curious development for an assault gun was an attempt to increase the firepower of the KV-chassis. At first trials were made with a casemate system housing the U-13 system incorporating two 45mm and one 76,2 guns to fire all at once or separate. This configuration was quickly forbidden by Stalin himself in December´41 and another configuration was found with the U-14 system incorporating two 76,2mm F-34 guns side by side ( with a 15°gun traverse each to the sides). In theory a salvo would consist of one gun firing, reloading and in the time the first gun reloads the second gun aims and fires... again in theory roughly raising the firing speed from approx.5 shots/minute for the F34 to 10 shots/minute, in reality it was much lower. However since the front casemate was heavily armoured with 85mm and around 20cm lower than the KV-1, it was hard to kill. With its Model V2K engine providing 600 HP its top road speed was 43km/h."

The new fighter was based closely on the design of the I-15bis, with a stronger structure, but was fitted with a manually retractable undercarriage to reduce drag. It reverted to the "gulled" upper wing of the original I-15 but used the Clark YH aerofoil of the I-15bis. The four 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns remained. The new fighter was to be powered by a Shvetsov M-62 an improved derivative of the Shvetsov M-25 that powered the I-15 and I-15bis with twin superchargers providing a maximum speed of 424 km/h at a higher service ceiling but it had no real advantage over the M-25V."

Some series had wooden outer wings and front fuselages to conserve metals, and throughout the production, engines and fuel tanks were upgraded for improved performance while retaining the same range. However the most notable change was the addition of larger defensive guns in the turret, using the 12,7mm UBT machine gun in place of the earlier 7,62mm  weapons. In addition, the gunner positions were armored. This extra weight was not offset by the newer engines however, and the IL-4 proved to be slower than the earlier versions at only 404 km/h.

It was a turretless, tracked armoured fighting vehicle designed by the Yekaterinburg-based Uralmash design bureau (UZTM) between autumn 1944 and spring 1945. It used the chassis of the T-44 medium tank and was intended to replace the SU-100 which itself had only entered service with the Red Army in late 1944. Two prototypes of the Uralmash-1 with different armament were built in early 1945, one with the 100 mm D-10 tank gun, the other with the 122 mm D-25S tank gun. While mass production was initially recommended, the end of the war with Germany in May 1945 eventually caused the project to be cancelled due to lack of necessity. If the Uralmash-1 had entered service, the 100 mm variant would have been designated SU-101 (СУ-101) while the 122 mm variant would have been designated SU-102 (СУ-102)."

When it first flew in 1937, it was the most massive and voluminous aircraft ever built in the US. It set a number of load-to-altitude records for land-based aircraft, including carrying a 14,154 kg payload to 2,500 m on 30 July 1939. The aircraft's immense size allowed flight engineers to enter the wing through a crawlway and make minor repairs in flight. A  8,000 km) flight took 33 hours at its 245 km/h cruising speed; so the 10-men crew was made up of several shifts, and bunks allowed them to sleep when off duty. The 보잉 design team eventually used four Pratt & Whitney R-1830-11 radial engines  developing 1000 each which allowed a maximum airspeed of 317 km/h. Its armament were three 7,62mm and three 12,7mm machine guns, its payload was up to 5400 kg of bombs."

It was known within the company as the Model 32, and some initial production aircraft were laid down as export models designated as various LB-30s, in the Land Bomber design category. At its inception, the B-24 was a modern design featuring a highly efficient shoulder-mounted, high aspect ratio Davis wing. The wing gave the Liberator a high cruise speed, long range and the ability to carry a heavy bomb load.  In comparison with its contemporaries, the B-24 was relatively difficult to fly and had poor low-speed performance; it also had a lower ceiling and was less robust than the 보잉 B-17 Flying Fortress. While aircrews tended to prefer the B-17, General Staff favored the B-24. The bomb load was up to 3600 kg and the defensive armament was four 7,62mm and three 12,7mm machine guns. Its maximum airspeed was around 420 km/h."

The mortar consists of a steel tube closed at one end by a steel base-plate, which rests on a wooden platform. The 300 kg shells fit around and on top of the tube, instead of being dropped inside, making this a spigot mortar. The range of each shot was adjusted by adding different size powder charges at the base of the round. The specially reinforced barrels could only handle 10 to 15 shots apiece before becoming damaged and unusable, for this reason the SPG carried a number of replacement spigot barrels. The SPG had a very limited range of 2000m ( 1200m with the regular version) and thus retained all secondary armament and armour of the tank version. A armoured crane helped with the loading of the oversized shells."

ITA_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "By June 1940, the bulk of the Regio Esercito armored forces was made of tankettes. These had several limitations, like weak protection, machine-gun armament, and no traversing turret, which all prevented any use against other tanks. This issue was first addressed with a prototype, the FIAT-Ansaldo Carro d’Assalto L5/36 based on a CV-35 tankette equipped with a new suspension and a light traversing turret, armed with a 37 mm L/26 gun and a coaxial 브레다 6.5 mm machine-gun. The armor was raised to 30 mm, speed lowered to 32 km/h and the range was only 80 km. A second prototype had the gun placed in the hull, and a fully traversible light machine-gun turret. Despite some production advantages, the Army choose a new scaled-up model. The designations of the italian light tanks were L for leggera/light, tonnage and year of service entry."

ITA_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The L6/40, first introduced in 1940, was a improvement of the L5/36. The hull was short and the maximum armor, 40 mm, was only found on the gun mantlet and frontal glacis, thought capable to stop the british 2 pounder (40 mm) gun fire, at least at higher ranges. The rest of the armor was and 20 to 6 mm thick. This was a cramped 2-man tank, with the gunner/commander on the left side, in the turret, and the driver on the right. The overall weight was 6.8 tons. The FIAT SPD 18D petrol four-cylinder developed 70 HP and allowed a top road speed of 32 km/h. The suspensions used a modern torsion-bar system, with front drive sprocket and rear idler wheel, two rubberized pairs of road wheels and three return rollers on each side. It was armed either with a 20mm 37/26 or modelo 35 autocannon. Due to performance demands of the army the L6/40 was further developed into the faster and better armed M6T and the preseries production started in May 1941."

ITA_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The medium tanks were still hampered by their riveted construction and old fashioned leaf spring bogie suspension, which limited top speed, so after the first encounters with British 순항전차 tanks, the idea soon emerged of a similar high speed vehicle. However in early 1941, italian engineers did not have access to the Christie suspension patent, so the design was obtained after reverse-engineering captured BT-5 from the spanish civil war and british 순항전차 Mk.III. It needed still further development and the armament was barely adequate at that time, but the decision was made to put it in production immediately and improve it "on the way". Although the armour was riveted, the 30mm frontal and the side armours were well sloped and gave the tank some protection at least against the british 2 pounder. The CA L16/41 weighed 16 tons, was armed with a 37mm L/32 gun and had a top road speed of 55 km/h."

A novelty was the placement of the final reduction gears inside the front-mounted drive sprockets, eliminating the need for enlarged final drive housings in the bow armour. Service use of the M11/39 was short due to several deficiencies in its design, particularly the placement of the main 37mm L/40 gun in the hull due to insufficient turret space which instead housed dual 8 mm machine guns. The M11/39 had other shortcomings: its endurance and performance were poor, and its SPA V8-diesel with 105 HP was underpowered only allowing a relatively slow top road speed of 32 km/h, it was mechanically unreliable and its 30 mm maximum riveted steel armour could only withstand 20 mm fire but was vulnerable to British 2파운더 guns at any range."

The inofficial Italian designation was Carro Armato P 25/40. Despite being called a heavy tank (P for Pesante) it was a medium tank in size, weight, armour, and armament. Design had started in 1940 but development and production were slow because of inavailablity of a suitable engine and due to a major redesign after the prototype was almost ready in late ´41 for production. The hasty redesign was caused by reports on the T-34 which came in from the east front. The armour on the P25 were 40mm on the front and turret both riveted and unsloped.

The simple production method, lack of a turret and lower weight of 13 tons makes this a highly effective vehicle against entrenched infantry and light units. The low silhouette also makes this tank a much smaller target than it's sibling tanks. Suspensions were of the reliable - but not suitable for speed - leaf spring type. The low muzzle velocity (around 450 m/s) and the maximum elevation of 22° limited the range to around 7–8 km.

Ansaldo therefore placed a Cannone da 149/40 modello 35 on a much modified Carro Armato M15/42 tank chassis. It was a completely unprotected weapon as the long gun barrel was placed on an open mounting carried on the turretless tank chassis. The gun crew stood in the open to serve the gun that had its trunnions mounted right to the rear to absorb some of the recoil forces produced on firing. The Cannone da 149/40 modello 35 could fire a 46 kg shell to a range of 23,7km, at which distance the lack of protection for the gun crew was thought of relatively little importance.

NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_01_short:0 "오스틴 7"
NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_01_desc:0 "A military liaison vehicle used to coordinate between units in the field and light transport. This is a military adaption of a later model of one of the most successful series of British cars, the 오스틴 7. The modifications are relatively sparse, with anything not strictly necessary stripped out, more storage, military wheels, tow rings and an altered fuel tank. Historically the 오스틴 7 was produced between 1922 and 1939. The British Army purchased a number of batches of 오스틴 7's for liaison use prewar. 오스틴 and 모리스 assembly in New Zealand started in 1934. Civilian cars of all kinds were requisitioned at the onset of war, and NZ infantry battalions had an official establishment of 6 오스틴 two-seaters as of 1941."

NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_02_short:0 "오스틴 8"
NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_02_desc:0 "The 오스틴 7 was succeeded by the 오스틴 8, which was slightly larger with improved engine and suspension. A large number of civilian models were requisitioned early war and modified, and a factory-built miltary version was constructed, the Military 8AP Tourer. Historically the 오스틴 8 started production in February 1939, and approximately 9000 Military 8AP Tourers were built."
NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_03:0 "트럭, Command and Reconnaissance, 1/4 ton, 4x4 Ford GPW"

NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_06_short:0 "랜체스터 6x4"
NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_06_desc:0 "Developed during the 1920s by the 랜체스터 Motor Company, the 6x4 had good cross country performance and was easy to maintain. It featured a fully traversing, two-man turret, but the 90 hp engine struggled with the vehicle's weight. First deployed in 1929, it served into the 1930s before being phased out."
NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_07:0 "모리스 CS9 장갑차"
NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_07_short:0 "모리스 CS9"
NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_07_desc:0 "Based on the chassis of the 모리스 Commercial C9 truck, the CS9 replaced a number of WWI-era designs. The open-top turret usually mounted a 13.7 mm Boys anti-tank rifle, and a 7.62 mm Bren light machine gun. The 94 hp engine gave the vehicle good performance on soft ground - when fitted with the correct tires."

NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_08_short:0 "다임러 2형"
NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_08_desc:0 "A heavier development of the successful 다임러 Dingo scout car. Produced in large quantities, their welded, sloped hulls were relatively well armoured, while the 4.1 litre 95 hp engine gave decent performance. The 장갑차 was equipped with a 2 pdr 40mm gun, and a coaxial 7.92 Besa machine gun."

NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_09_short:0 "험버 4형"
NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_09_desc:0 "Made by the Rootes Group by combining the Indian Army's Karrier KT4 artillery tractor, with the Guy 장갑차. The definitive production Mk.IV version mounted a US-made 37 mm gun, and a 7.92 mm coaxial Besa machine gun. The vehicle had a long career and surplus 험버s were sold to nations all over the world."

NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_099_short:0 "AEC 2형"
NZL_motorized_AC_equipment_099_desc:0 "Built by the Associated 장비 Company on the chassis of their Matador 4x4 artillery tractor. The 158 hp diesel engine enabled the vehicle to mount a 6 pdr 57 mm gun, and coaxial 7.92 mm Besa machine gun, while still maintaining excellent mobility on long patrols. The AEC remained valuable for years to come."

NZL_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "With the UK occupied fully with it's own rearmament, New Zealand assessed a number of stopgap concepts as it developed it's military industry. This is a domestic prototype based on the same concept as the US Disston Tractor Tank. It consists of corrugated iron plates mounted on a large tractor chassis. Historically the prototypes were constructed very quickly adhoc, without plans."

NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "스코필드 1형 경전차"
NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "This is a more developed domestic concept based on a 유니버설 수송차 chassis. It had an unusual combination of tracks with demountable road wheels, that gave it respectable strategic speed. The design was in all other respects mediocre, but would have been better than no tank at all."
NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_2:0 "빅커스 5형 경전차"
NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "5형 경전차"
NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The first Commonwealth three-man 경전차 in service. The extra crew member, and an updated armament of 7.7 mm and 15 mm Besa machine guns in a twin mount, made the Mk.V a far more effective combat vehicle. The increase in weight affected mobility on rough ground somewhat, but overall range was largely unchanged."

NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "6형 경전차"
NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Built in several versions, and in large quantities. The Mk.VIa retained the armament of the Mk.V, while the Mk.VIb had a compact 15 mm Besa and an upgraded 7.92 mm coaxial. The Mk.VIc kept the 7.92 mm coaxial, while the main gun was a long barrel 15 mm Besa, which had excellent muzzle velocity but limited punch."
NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_4:0 "7형 경전차 A17 테트라크"
NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_4_short:0 "테트라크"
NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "빅커스-암스트롱 chief tank designer - Leslie Little - designed the 테트라크 as a major upgrade to the Mk.VI. It had a 2 pdr 40 mm gun with a 7.92 mm Besa coaxial, and a new coil suspension system. The light weight of the vehicle coupled with the Meadows 165 hp engine, made the Tetratch fast and easy to transport."

NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_5_short:0 "해리 홉킨스 경전차"
NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "The last of the 빅커스-암스트롱 경전차s produced. Developed from the 테트라크, the length, width, and armour protection of the Mk.VIII was increased, and a new power-assisted steering system was installed. Mk.VIIIs served in mainly auxillary roles as Commonwealth armoured divisions gradually withdrew 경전차s."
