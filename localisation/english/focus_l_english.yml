 NZL_import_restrictions:0 "Import Restrictions"
 NZL_import_restrictions_desc:0 "One step we are considering is restricting imports of many manufactured goods, to encourage local manufacturing. This proved haphazard in it's effects, but encouraged many industries that did important work during the war years ahead."

 NZL_armor_valentine:0 "License Valentine Tank Design"

 NZL_armor_m3:0 "License M3 Lee Design"
 NZL_armor_m3_desc:0 "Should British designs prove unsuitable or delayed, we can seek the assistance of the great Arsenal of Democracy. Historically, Canada built licensed M3 chassis for their Ram Tanks, although they did not see combat."
 NZL_armor_m4:0 "License M4 Sherman Design"
 NZL_armor_m4_desc:0 "The M3 was succeeded by the superior Sherman. Historically the Allies agreed to standardise on the M4, and Canada produced their own version under license as the Grizzly."
 NZL_armor_salvage:0 "Refurbish Salvaged Equipment"
 NZL_armor_salvage_desc:0 "The spoils of war belong to the victor. Our forces in the field have 'acquired' some damaged or abandoned tanks and other armoured vehicles of various types. These can be put back in the field under new ownership with a modest amount of effort."
 NZL_mechanization_effort:0 "Mechanisation of Support Arms"
 NZL_mechanization_effort_desc:0 "We can focus our planning efforts on increased mechanisation of our infantry and their support arms."

 NZL_2NZEF:0 "Form the 2NZEF"
 NZL_2NZEF_desc:0 "New Zealanders in combat will probably be doing so well distant to our shores. Only abroad can those who threaten our interests be defeated. We can start creating the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force."

 NZL_coastal_forts:0 "Upgrade Coastal Defences"

 NZL_operations_europe_desc:0 "The defining conflict will be once again in Western Europe, where our fallen from the last War lie from Flanders Fields and the Somme."
 NZL_operations_middle_east:0 "Planning Effort for Middle East"
 NZL_operations_middle_east_desc:0 "Just as we fought in the Suez, Sinai and Palestine in the Great War, so we may be asked to fight again in the scorching sands. Our lines of supply are shorter here, and the Commonwealth sees us as hardy colonials suited to hard terrain."
 NZL_operations_pacific:0 "Planning Effort for Pacific"
 NZL_operations_pacific_desc:0 "Our home cannot be neglected. The security of the Pacific has always required any attacker from the North to be delayed until the Royal Navy can muster it's strength."

 NZL_NAV_effort:0 "Air Patrols over the Pacific"
 NZL_NAV_effort_desc:0 "The distances to be covered in the South Pacific are vast, and our naval forces few. Aircraft are an efficient means of keeping watch over the waters to our north."

 NZL_assist_RAF:0 "Transfer Bombers and Crews to RAF"
 NZL_assist_RAF_desc:0 "Where Britain goes, we go. Where she stands, we stand. We have a purchasing option for 30 bombers, with crew training in the UK. Let us offer these to the RAF. Historically the New Zealand Wellington bomber flight then became No.75 (NZ) Squadron RAF."
 NZL_assist_RAF2:0 "Join the BCATP"
 NZL_assist_RAF2_desc:0 "The British Commonwealth Air Training Plan was a massive joint aircrew training program created by the UK, Canada, Australia and NZ. New Zealand went on to provide 2,743 pilots for the RAF during the war."

 NZL_technology_sharing_comm:0 "Commonwealth Mutual Aid"

 NZL_radio_industry:0 "Radio Industry"
 NZL_radio_industry_desc:0 "Our fledgling radio industry is expanding rapidly to cope with our own needs. We can expand further to export additional radios and even radar units to our allies."
 # Singapore
 NZL_singapore_focus:0 "The Singapore Strategy"
 NZL_singapore_focus_desc:0 "From the 1920's our core defence policy has been to rely on Royal Navy assistance, sustained by a fortified naval base. It's status as a symbol of Imperial commitment helped obscure the growing strategic weaknesses in the strategy. Historically New Zealand helped fund the Naval base, which was finished in 1939."
 NZL_singapore_forts:0 "Contribute to Landward Forts"
 NZL_singapore_forts_desc:0 "For better or for worse, work on the grandly-named 'Fortress Singapore' goes slowly. The Singapore Strategy as written requires Australasia to hold on until the Royal Navy can arrive. Contributing to defence works is an option we can choose. Historically the UK started work on ground fortifications, unfinished when invasion occurred."
 # Naval Tree
 NZL_naval_effort:0 "Develop Shipbuilding"
 NZL_naval_effort_desc:0 "Our country has an established, if modest, shipbuilding industry. Historically, shipyard expansion for repairs and the construction of minesweepers and smaller craft occurred from 1940. However, our citizens and policies support industrialisation, and we can focus on shipbuilding now if we so choose." 
 NZL_navy_doctrine:0 "Our Place in the World"

 NZL_destroyer_effort2:0 "Patrol Craft"
 NZL_destroyer_effort2_desc:0 "Our waters need defenders. We can start planning for the construction of smaller craft on our own initiative. Historically motor launches were constructed that saw service in the island campaigns. In total nearly 500 vessels were constructed during the war, and at least partial repairs done on over 1000 US ships."
 NZL_navy_doctrine2:0 "Form the RNZN"
 NZL_navy_doctrine2_desc:0 "As the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy, due to expansion our forces are largely self-sufficient and independent of the Royal Navy. Identifying our navy as our own recognises this fact. Historically this occurred 1 October 1941."
 NZL_cruiser_effort:0 "British Cruiser Designs"
 NZL_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Cruisers have long patrolled the South Pacific, being a versatile and balanced ship with adequate range. Perhaps it is time we constructed our own."

We have no steel-workers not already engaged on essential work. However, we can rapidly retrain and supervise carpenters and other trainees, use coachbuilding firms, and bring in steel-workers from the Railway Workshops. Historically over 100 vessels were built."
 # Island Defence
 NZL_fiji_focus:0 "Defence of the Local Islands"
 NZL_fiji_focus_desc:0 "Our means may be limited, but we can still look to our own defence. To the west lies the bulwark of Australia. The most direct threat to our trade and freedom will come from the north. We can build a base in Fiji to help protect our coastal waters."
 NZL_fiji_focus2:0 "Reinforce Fiji"
 NZL_fiji_focus2_desc:0 "We can further develop the installations in our northern neighbour."
 # Look Outside the Commonwealth

 NZL_technology_sharing_desc:0 "By sharing technological advances with our allies, our whole faction will be able to conduct wartime R&D more efficiently."
 NZL_political_effort:0 "Look Beyond the Commonwealth"
 NZL_political_effort_desc:0 "New powers are arising in the Pacific, and Britain is occupied ever-more distantly in Europe. While our ties to Britain may remain, our country's needs may require us to look at other options as well. Historically this occurred during the close cooperation with the US needed during the Pacific campaign, and the reality of a US-dominated Pacific after the end of the war."
 NZL_collectivist_ethos:0 "Collectivist Ethos"

 NZL_deterrence:0 "Deterrence"
 NZL_deterrence_desc:0 "Standing alone, we rarely benefit from war. Fortunately, we know that the best defense is one so well-known you never have to put it to use."
 NZL_volunteer_corps:0 "Volunteer Corps"
 NZL_volunteer_corps_desc:0 "Forcing our people to die for ideals of freedom would be an exercise in irony, but establishing means for those who wish to aid people abroad is not."
 NZL_paramilitarism:0 "Paramilitarism"
 NZL_paramilitarism_desc:0 "Military principles have applications outside of the military. With the development of semi-militarized units to complement our armed forces, more people will have military training."
 NZL_indoctrination_focus:0 "Indoctrination"

 NZL_ideological_fanaticism:0 "Ideological Fanaticism"
 NZL_ideological_fanaticism_desc:0 "Our politically established values and goals are worth dying for as much as any ancient faith. Any follower should be prepared to face death, and those who stray better be prepared to face death."
